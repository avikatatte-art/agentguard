---

## 🎬 **3-Minute Demo Script**

### **Opening Hook (15 seconds)**
```
"Last month, a company lost $2M in 4 hours because 
one AI agent failed and cascaded to 12 others. 
Nobody knew the dependencies existed.

We built the solution."
```

### **Problem Setup (30 seconds)**
```
"Companies are deploying 10-50 AI agents:
- Pricing agents
- Inventory agents  
- Support agents
- Content agents

But they have ZERO visibility into:
❌ Which agents depend on each other
❌ What breaks when one fails
❌ How to recover quickly
❌ Proof for compliance"
```

### **Solution Demo (2 minutes)**

**Screen 1: Scan (20 seconds)**
```
"AgentGuard scans your agent ecosystem.
[Click Demo Dataset]
Found 24 agents, 4 shadow agents detected.
[Click Generate Map]"
```

**Screen 2: Graph (30 seconds)**
```
"Here's the dependency map.
[Point to graph]
Red nodes = single points of failure
Yellow = circular dependencies
Risk score: 8.5/10 - CRITICAL

[Click PricingAgent]
This agent has 12 downstream dependencies.
Let's see what happens if it fails.
[Click Simulate]"
```

**Screen 3: Simulation (30 seconds)**
```
"Simulating PricingAgent failure...
[Results appear]
Blast radius: 9.2/10
12 agents impacted
8 workflows affected
Revenue risk: $500K-2M per hour

This is a disaster waiting to happen.
[Click Generate Playbook]"
```

**Screen 4: Playbook (40 seconds)**
```
"AgentGuard generates a recovery playbook:
- Step 1: Switch to cached pricing (0-5 min)
- Step 2: Activate backup agent (5-15 min)  
- Step 3: Full recovery (15-30 min)

Each step has verification checks.

And here's the key differentiator:
[Scroll to Audit Trail]

Every dependency has evidence:
- Trace IDs
- Timestamps
- Confidence scores

And it's tamper-proof:
[Show blockchain proof]
Stored on Polygon blockchain.
SOC2 compliance ready."
```

### **Closing (15 seconds)**
```
"AgentGuard: Google Maps + Fire Drill for AI agents.

Prevent cascade failures.
Generate recovery playbooks.
Tamper-proof audit trails.

The reliability layer for the AI agent revolution."
```

## 🗣️ **Answering Judge Questions**

### **Q: "How is this different from Datadog?"**
```
"Datadog monitors individual services.
We map agent-to-agent dependencies and predict cascades.

Think: Datadog shows you ONE tree.
We show you the FOREST and which trees will fall together."
```

### **Q: "How do you handle false positives?"**
```
"Three layers:
1. Confidence scores on every edge (ML-based)
2. Evidence linking (trace IDs, timestamps)
3. Human-in-loop approval for critical actions

Our goal: High recall, then refine precision."
```

### **Q: "What's your moat?"**
```
"Data network effects.
Every incident we analyze → better playbooks
Every graph we build → better risk models

Plus: First mover in new category = we define it."
```

### **Q: "Why blockchain?"**
```
"Post-incident, companies ask: 'Did you tamper with logs?'
Blockchain provides immutable proof for:
- Compliance (SOC2, ISO27001)
- Insurance claims
- Legal disputes

It's not about decentralization, it's about trust."
```

### **Q: "How do you monetize?"**
```
"SaaS model:
- Startup tier: $500/month (<10 agents)
- Growth tier: $2K/month (<50 agents)
- Enterprise: $10K+/month (unlimited + compliance)

TAM: 10,000 companies deploying agents by 2026
= $600M market"
```

### **Q: "What's your go-to-market?"**
```
"Bottom-up:
1. Free agent dependency audit (lead gen)
2. 5 design partners (credibility)
3. Product Hunt launch (awareness)
4. PagerDuty/Datadog partnerships (distribution)

Target: DevOps/SRE teams, then CTO."
```
