## **Demo Script**

### **⏱️ 0:00 - 0:15 | Opening Hook (15 seconds)**

> **"Last month, a company lost $2 million in 4 hours because one AI agent failed and cascaded to 12 others."**
>
> **"Nobody knew the dependencies existed."**
>
> **"We built the solution."**

**[Pause for impact]**

---

### **⏱️ 0:15 - 0:45 | Problem Setup (30 seconds)**

> **"Companies are deploying 10 to 50 AI agents across their systems:**
> - Pricing agents
> - Inventory agents
> - Support agents
> - Content agents
>
> **But they have ZERO visibility into:**
> - ❌ Which agents depend on each other
> - ❌ What breaks when one fails
> - ❌ How to recover quickly
> - ❌ Proof for compliance"

### **⏱️ 0:45 - 1:05 | Screen 1: Scan (20 seconds)**

**[Click "Scan Demo Dataset"]**

> **"AgentGuard scans your agent ecosystem."**
>
> **[Results appear]**
>
> **"Found 24 agents in this e-commerce system."**
>
> **"4 shadow agents detected - undocumented legacy systems."**

**[Auto-navigates to graph]**

### **⏱️ 1:05 - 1:35 | Screen 2: Dependency Graph (30 seconds)**

**[Graph loads]**

> **"Here's the dependency map."**
>
> **[Point to red nodes]**
>
> **"Red nodes are single points of failure."**
>
> **[Point to right panel]**
>
> **"Risk score: 8.5 out of 10 - CRITICAL."**
>
> **"PricingAgent is a major SPOF with 12 downstream dependencies."**
>
> **"Let's see what happens if it fails."**

**[Click "Simulate Failure"]**

---

### **⏱️ 1:35 - 2:05 | Screen 3: Simulation (30 seconds)**

**[Simulation page loads with PricingAgent pre-selected]**

**[Click "Simulate Failure"]**

**[Results appear]**

> **"Blast radius: 9.2 out of 10."**
>
> **"12 agents impacted."**
>
> **"8 workflows affected."**
>
> **"Revenue risk: $500K to $2M per hour."**
>
> **[Pause]**
>
> **"This is a disaster waiting to happen."**

**[Click "Generate Recovery Playbook"]**

---

### **⏱️ 2:05 - 2:45 | Screen 4: Playbook + Audit Trail (40 seconds)** ⭐

**[Playbook page loads]**

> **"AgentGuard generates a recovery playbook powered by Gemini 2.0."**
>
> **[Scroll through steps]**
>
> **"Step 1: Immediate containment - switch to cached pricing."**
>
> **"Step 2: Activate backup agent."**
>
> **"Step 3: Full recovery."**
>
> **"Each step has verification checks."**
>
> **[Scroll to right sidebar]**
>
> **"And here's the key differentiator..."**
>
> **[Point to Audit Trail]**
>
> **"Every dependency has evidence:**
> - Trace IDs
> - Timestamps  
> - Confidence scores
> - Observed frequency"
>
> **[Scroll to Blockchain Proof]**
>
> **"And it's tamper-proof."**
>
> **"Stored on Polygon blockchain."**
>
> **"SOC2 compliance ready."**

---

### **⏱️ 2:45 - 3:00 | Closing (15 seconds)**

> **"AgentGuard: Google Maps plus Fire Drill for AI agents."**
>
> **"Prevent cascade failures."**
>
> **"Generate recovery playbooks."**
>
> **"Tamper-proof audit trails."**
>
> **[Pause]**
>
> **"The reliability layer for the AI agent revolution."**

**[Smile and wait for questions]**

## **Backup Talking Points**

### **If Asked: "How is this different from Datadog?"**

> "Datadog monitors individual services. We map agent-to-agent dependencies and predict cascades. Think: Datadog shows you ONE tree. We show you the FOREST and which trees will fall together."

### **If Asked: "How do you handle false positives?"**

> "Three layers: Confidence scores on every edge using ML, evidence linking with trace IDs and timestamps, and human-in-loop approval for critical actions."

### **If Asked: "What's your moat?"**

> "Data network effects. Every incident we analyze makes our playbooks better. Every graph we build improves our risk models. Plus, we're first mover in a new category."

### **If Asked: "Why blockchain?"**

> "Post-incident, companies ask: 'Did you tamper with logs?' Blockchain provides immutable proof for compliance, insurance claims, and legal disputes. It's not about decentralization, it's about trust."

### **If Asked: "How do you monetize?"**

> "SaaS model: $500/month for startups, $2K for growth, $10K+ for enterprise. Companies will pay because agent failures cost millions. Our TAM is 10,000 companies deploying agents by 2026."
