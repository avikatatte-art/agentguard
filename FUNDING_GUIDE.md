## **How to Raise Money for AgentGuard**

---

## 🎯 **Funding Roadmap**

```
Hackathon → Design Partners → Paid Beta → Seed Round → Series A
   $0           $0              $50K        $2-5M       $15-30M
  Week 0      Month 1-3        Month 3-6   Month 6-12   Month 18-24
```

---

## 💎 **Investment Thesis**

### **Why AgentGuard is Fundable**

**1. Category Creation**
- First mover in "Multi-Agent Reliability"
- Define the category = own the category
- Precedent: Datadog (APM), PagerDuty (Incident), Snyk (Security)

**2. Market Timing**
```
2023: ChatGPT explosion
2024: RAG everywhere
2025: Agent deployment wave ← YOU ARE HERE
2026: Agent reliability crisis
```

**3. Expensive Problem**
- Agent cascade failure = $500K-2M/hour downtime
- Compliance violations = $10M+ fines
- Insurance requirements emerging

**4. Strong Moat**
- Data network effects (more incidents → better playbooks)
- Integration lock-in (embedded in workflow)
- Knowledge graph (proprietary dependency patterns)

**5. Clear Path to $100M ARR**
```
Year 1:  100 customers × $2K/mo  = $2.4M ARR
Year 2:  500 customers × $4K/mo  = $24M ARR
Year 3: 1000 customers × $8K/mo  = $96M ARR
```

   Subject: Free Agent Dependency Audit
   
   Hi [Name],
   
   I noticed [Company] is deploying AI agents for [use case].
   
   We built a tool that maps agent dependencies and predicts 
   cascade failures. Think "Google Maps for your agent ecosystem."
   
   Would you be open to a free audit? Takes 30 minutes, you get:
   - Dependency graph of your agents
   - Single points of failure identified
   - Blast radius analysis
   
   No strings attached. Just want to learn from you.

## 🎯 **Final Funding Advice**

### **1. Traction > Everything**
Investors fund momentum, not ideas.

### **2. Tell a Story**
"We prevent million-dollar agent failures" > feature list

Demo > Deck > Pitch

### **4. Build Relationships Early**
Start conversations 6 months before you need money

### **5. Don't Optimize for Valuation**
Optimize for:
- Right partner
- Enough runway
